These PCB's and Schematic diagrams were used to create the robotic arm.

There are multiple "Extender" PCB's as there were subcircuit components (ie the ultrasonic) that were
better suited to be attached to a board rather than connected to the base board with long wires
The colour sensor required it's own circuit board as it was created with raw parts and the parts needed specific placement
(ie the RGB LEDs needed to be equally as close to each other with a photoresistor).

The base PCB was purposefully created large as it also acts as an ardiuno mount
