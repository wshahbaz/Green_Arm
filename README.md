# Robot_Arm

This is a project I completed in grade 12.

It is a 5-servo robotic arm, powered by an Arduino with a colour sensor and detectors, to intelligently locate a coloured barrel, pick it up and configure its colour, and place it onto its designated zone.

The colour sensor was created with raw materials, and all parts of the arm were 3D printed or constructed by hand.
